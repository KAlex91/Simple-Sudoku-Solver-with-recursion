This is a classic sudoku solver using recursion.
The goal of this project was to illustrate in a simple yet elegant way a case where using recursion is, in cases, a much better solution than using loops.
The input in this case is a manually added sudoku grid in the form of a matrix, where 0 is the placeholder value for empty cells.
